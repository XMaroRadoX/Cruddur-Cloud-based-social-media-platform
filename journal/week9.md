# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment), which is a set of practices and principles aimed at improving the efficiency, speed, and quality of software development and delivery.

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automatically building and testing code changes every time a developer pushes new code to a shared repository. This helps to catch and fix issues early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of bugs and conflicts when integrating different pieces of code.

Continuous Delivery (CD) goes a step further by automating the release process of the software to production. This includes building, testing, and deploying the code changes to a staging environment for further testing, and then to production if all tests pass.

Continuous Deployment (CD) is similar to continuous delivery but includes the automated deployment of the code changes to production without human intervention after all tests pass in the staging environment.

By implementing CI/CD, development teams can increase collaboration and communication, accelerate the development and delivery process, reduce errors and defects, and improve the overall quality and reliability of their software.
