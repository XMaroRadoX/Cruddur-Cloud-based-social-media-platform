Amazon RDS - Security Best Practices - AWS:

â€¢ Use VPCs: Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create a private
network for your RDS instance. This helps prevent unauthorized access
to your instance from the public internet.
â€¢ Compliance standard is what your business requires
â€¢ RDS Instances should only be in the AWS region that you are legally
allowed to be holding user data in.
â€¢ Amazon Organizations SCP - to manage RDS deletion, RDS creation,
region lock, RDS Encryption enforced etc
â€¢ AWS CloudTrail is enabled & monitored to trigger alerts on malicious
RDS behaviour by an identity in AWS.
â€¢ Amazon Guardduty is enabled in the account and region of RDS


Amazon RDS - Security Best Practices - Application:


â€¢ RDS Instance to use appropriate Authentication -Use IAM
authentication, kerberos etc (not the default)
â€¢ Database User Lifecycle Management - Create, Modify, Delete Users
â€¢ AWS User Access Lifecycle Management - Change of Roles/ Revoke
Roles etc
â€¢ Security Group to be restricted only to known IPs
â€¢ Not have RDS be internet accessible
â€¢ Encryption in Transit for comms between App & RDS
â€¢ Secret Management: Master User passwords can be used with AWS
Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secrets for Amazon RDS.
