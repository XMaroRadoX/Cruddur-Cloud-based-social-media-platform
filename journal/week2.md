# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Learning Time 
### Watching the livestream 
 Notes:
 When software is bigger than just code you need to observe every part of the system
 Programs -> debuggers Systems-> Observilibity
 We keep track of a request throught the whole system and it's lifecycle through different services (A trace)
 AWS-Xray is hard to insturment as opposite to honeycomb which is scalabe to teams
Export -> for all shells other than that we are setting the value in the current shell only
When in production use the most minimal image to optmize for security to speed and in develeompent do the opposite to make the most comfortable expreience for your devs
