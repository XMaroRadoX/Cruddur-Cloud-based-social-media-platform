Table Design:

  Notes :
  When Designing a DynamoDB Table take note of access pattern and scienaros that users will engage through
  nosql tables don't have joins so be careful when Designing your DynamoDB
  particledb is a tool to make nosql act like a sql one

  Primary key vs partition key 
  primary key can be simple = partition key 
  partition key can be primary key + sort key
